DEPENDENCIES
============
The lvtk_core module does not depend on any third party library except for
JUCE core and a recent version of the LV2 headers installed

The lvtk_plugins requires David Drobilla's LV2 host libraries.  Lilv is used
for plugins and Suil for Plugin UI's.  Lilv and Suil additionally depend on
Drobilla's serd, serd, sratom RDF/Atom parsers.

PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM
=====================

1.) Compile and install LV2, Lilv, and Suil
2.) Include this module in your Introjucer project
